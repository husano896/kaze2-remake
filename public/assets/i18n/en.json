The planetary environment is similar to Earth, and many creatures exist here, including humans, dragonborn, and beastfolk.\n\nInitially, communicating across such a vast distance would have been impossible, but thanks to artifacts excavated from ancient ruins left on our planet, communication utilizing quantum technology has become possible.\n\nWith this groundbreaking communication system, we can reach your side of the network \"World Wide Web\" through this website."},"IndexDoc2":{"Title":"Motivation for this site hosting","Description":"Currently, in our world, a disease known as the \"Dragon Death Disease\" is spreading, causing catastrophic damage. This disease has an extremely high fatality rate, and the modes of transmission are still unknown.\n\nWhile it is now clear that the disease only affects dragonborns since its emergence, prejudice and discrimination against them have spread. The number of baby dragonborns becoming orphans or abandoned due to the disease continues to rise.\nIn response, the Dragon Disease Protection Association has partnered with Poiltop to begin efforts to protect and raise the orphaned dragonlings.\n\nHowever, Poiltop is not financially wealthy and has limited volunteer resources.\nTherefore, we have decided to search and recruit volunteers from the entire universe to assist in these dragonlings' emotional care and upbringing.\nWe have set up access points on three planets, including one on Earth.\n\nDragonlings need your help.\nWe need your help.\n\nPlease lend us your strength."},"IndexDoc3":{"Title":"About Poiltop","Description1":"Poiltop is a small port town with a population of around 20,000.\nApart from fishing, there are no notable industries, but what makes it unique is the active interracial communication. Humans, Dragonborn, and Beastfolks live in harmony together here, and it is affectionately called the \"city where humans and dragonborn walk together.\"\n\nIn addition, there are many ancient ruins around Poiltop. Artifacts excavated from those ruins created the Quantum Network Systems (QNS) that made communication across the universe possible.\n\nWe established a Protection and Support for Diseased Dragons based on these.","Description2":"Words from the caretaker, Mr. Niel\n\n\"Uh, well...w-what should I say? I'm not good at this kind of stuff...\"\n\n\"Ah...The dragonlings I care for have been through a lot, but they're all healthy... They even caused me trouble yesterday with their mischief...They eat well...Huh? No more space left!?\"\n\n\"A...anyway, we're looking forward to you joining. There's no need to be too formal; it's a volunteer job. I want you to become friends with me and the dragonlings.
